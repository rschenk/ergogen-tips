# Using zones for footprints and outlines

Imagine you want to place mounting holes on your board. On the PCB you want a footprint, and on the top plate outline you want a `circle` in the exact same location. 

One way to accomplish this is to list out all the anchors for those circles in the `outlines:` section, then list out all those same anchors for the footprints in the `pcbs:` section. This is not a great idea because it's verbose and extremely prone to error. If you tweak the location of a hole in the outlines section but for get to do the same for the footprint in the pcb section, the holes won't line up and the case won't bolt together. You could use YAML anchors and aliases to share the anchors between the two sections, but this is still not idealâ€”adding or removing a mounting hole still requires duplicate changes in both sections. 

What we want is a single place to define the locations of the mounting holes, and be able to iterate through them in both the outlines and pcbs sectieons. You can do this with `points.zone`, but it requires a couple tricks to make it work. The first, and least intuitive, is that you'll need a separate zone for each individual mounting hole. The second is that you'll need to use tags to filter the keys from the mounting holes.

## Example

```yaml
meta:
  engine: "4.0.0"

points:
  zones.matrix:
    # Use a tag to keep the keys separate from mounting holes
    key.tags: [key]	# <--
    columns:
      pinky:
      ring.key.stagger: 0.66U
      middle.key.stagger: 0.25U
      index.key.stagger: -0.25U
      inner.key.stagger: -0.15U
    rows:
      bottom.padding: U
      home.padding: U
      top.padding: U

  zones.thumb:
    # Here too
    key.tags: [key] # <--
    anchor:
      ref: matrix_index_bottom
      shift: [0.66U, -1.25U]
      rotate: -10
    columns:
      tucky:
        key.name: thumb_tucky
      reachy:
        key.spread: U
        key.splay: -15
        key.origin: [-0.5U, -0.5U]
        key.name: thumb_reachy
 
  # Create a zone for each individual mounting hole
  zones.mounting_hole_top_left:
    # Use a tag to keep the mounting holes separate from keys
    key.tags: [mounting_hole] # <--
    anchor:
      ref: matrix_middle_bottom
      shift: [-3.25U, 2.2U]

  zones.mounting_hole_bottom_left:
    $extends: points.zones.mounting_hole_top_left
    anchor.shift: [, -2.2U]

  zones.mounting_hole_middle_right:
    $extends: points.zones.mounting_hole_top_left
    anchor.shift: [3.25U, 0.5U]

outlines:
  outline:
    - what: rectangle
      where: 
        ref: matrix_middle_bottom
      size: [8U, 6U]
      corner: 3

  top_plate:
    - name: outline

    # Add switch cutouts for each key
    - what: rectangle
      where: key # <--
      operation: stack
      bound: false
      size: [14, 14]
    
    # Add holes for each mounting hole
    - what: circle
      where: mounting_hole # <--
      operation: stack
      radius: 1.5

pcbs:
  example:
    outlines:
      main:
        outline: outline
    footprints:

      # Place a switch footprint for each key
      choc_switch:
        what: choc
        where: key
        params.from: "{{colrow}}"
        params.to: GND
      
      # Place a mounting hole footprint for each mounting hole
      # Note that I used `what: via` below so it would work in the GUI, but
      # you'd want to use an actual mounting hole footprint in real life
      mounting_hole:
        what: via 
        where: mounting_hole
        params.net: example
```
