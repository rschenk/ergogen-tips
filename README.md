# Ergogen Tips and Tricks

A collection of tips and tricks I've learned from the [Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen) community, with examples that run in the [GUI](https://ergogen.cache.works)

- [Mirror refs within the `points` section](using-mirror-coordinates-within-zones.md) - `mirror_*` refs are great for centering things on monoblock boards, but how do you use them within the `points` section?
- [Using zones to DRY up outlines and footprints](zones-for-footrpints-and-outlines.md) - Maybe you want to lay out mounting holes, but you need footprints on the pcb, and `circle`s on the plate outline? Use zones to keep that DRY.
- [Prefer `$extends` to YAML anchors](prefer-extends-to-yaml-anchors.md) - Keep your files DRY and interoperable
